# Instructions:
* You have to download the pre-trained fastText model from here [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/docs/pretrained-vectors.md). I chose wiki.ar.
* Do not forget to change the path of the read files as it is in your machine.
* You have to build vectors (run the two files of building vectors) then run the classification model file.
* You may find differences in the classification results compared to the results in [my paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-29513-4_21), because the dataset was re-processed and re-cleaned then uploaded in this folder:[MasterThesis](https://github.com/Nuhagh/MastersThesis).
